# Winter's Append
My first mod (to be shared publicly), feel free to shame me for bad practices (but please say how to fix them).

[List of Effects](Docs/Effects.md)<br>
[Tonic Json Format](Docs/tonic_recipe.jsonc)
## Features
- Tonics!<br>
A new potion type, slow to drink, typically weaker in terms of effects, slower, AND more expensive to make, but always lasts for a long time.
- Tonic Brewing Stand<br>
A separate brewing stand, specifically for making Tonics! Use Blaze Powder, Gypsophila (a new flower), and up to three ingredients to add an effect!
